# Orbis AI Detector – MVP

## Description

This project is a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** designed to detect AI-generated content in coders submissions.  
It simulates the integration with **Moodle** by allowing coders to upload their assignments, automatically analyzing the file with **OpenAI**, and providing a **Team Leader (TL) panel** to review results and give feedback.  

The goal is to support academic evaluation by highlighting potential AI-assisted work and streamlining the review process for instructors.

## Features

- **File Upload (Coder Simulation):** Submit a file (PDF) along with coder name and training name.  
- **Automatic AI Detection:** Backend sends the file to OpenAI with a custom prompt that returns:  
  - `ia_percentage` (0–100)  
  - `ia_detected` (true/false, based on >50%)  
  - `explanation` (brief text ≤200 characters)  
- **Database Storage:** All submissions, analyses, and feedback are stored in a relational database.  
- **Team Leader Panel:**  
  - Table with all analyzed submissions.  
  - Modal view with analysis details.  
  - Ability to add, update, or delete feedback.  
- **Simple Navigation:**  
  - “Upload File” (Coder simulation).  
  - “Show Analysis” (Team Leader view).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend (Coder + TL Panel):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla + Fetch API)  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **External API:** OpenAI API (custom JSON prompt for AI detection)  
- **Other Tools:** GitHub Projects (SCRUM board), VSCode
